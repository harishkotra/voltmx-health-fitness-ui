# voltmx-health-fitness-ui

The idea of Health & Fitness UI is to create a compelling and attractive user experience for a health and fitness based application where the user can set their fitness goals, track on a daily basis and also see their progress towards a healthier lifestyle.

Health &; Fitness UI is built using HCL's Volt MX Iris and Foundry (to publish a web preview) completely using the existing library default components and a custom HTML component to provide animations in the user interface. All screenshots for the app are provided below and the pitch video is a walk through of how the app looks and was built using Volt MX.
